# Actias
Welcome to the innovative world of the Actias, a software synthesizer that taps into the science of quantum computers to transform your approach to sound design. With Actias, you'll explore new ways of composing music, thanks to its quantum-inspired algorithms. Craft intricate patches between qubits and instruments, design circuits to combine your qubits, and hear the results as your quantum systems collapse.
